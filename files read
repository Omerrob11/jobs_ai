how to learn the css:
- fuck articles
- go concept by concept, ask claude to teach you that
- learn by doing- literally create it, and do that by doing
- because you will need to master react

I think that you can:
- learn nodejs, next js by 15 to february - a month from now
- and then, until 1.04, be master desginer and learn to create beautiful websites
- you do that by creating landing pages for others, and create projects and internatl tools for you
- create landing after landing, literally be in facebook and give the code for free
- 800 ils for implementation
