Box Model (Most Critical):


Content box vs border box
How margin, padding, and border work together
Understanding width/height calculations
Why elements take certain spaces
Box-sizing behavior


Display Properties:

Block vs Inline vs Inline-block
Understanding why elements stack or flow  - Natural element flow
How width and height affect each type
Default behaviors of common elements

Visual Hierarchy & Flow:

Document Flow Basics

Natural stacking
Parent-child relationships
Overflow behaviors
Containing blocks

Flexbox (Super Important):


Main axis vs cross axis
How flex-grow and flex-shrink work
Why items align the way they do
Space distribution concepts


Position (Essential):


Static vs Relative vs Absolute vs Fixed
How positioning contexts work
When to use each type
Stacking context with z-index


Units and Sizing:
Relative units (rem, em) vs absolute (px)
Viewport units (vh, vw)
Percentage behaviors
When to use each type


Visual Hierarchy Concepts:
How elements naturally stack
Parent-child relationships
Why overflow happens
Containing blocks


CRUCIAL CONCEPTS TO MASTER:

Layout Flow:


How elements naturally flow
What causes line breaks
When elements stack
How floats affect layout


Spacing Rules:

Margin collapsing
When padding is better than margin
How white space works
Auto margins behavior


Containment:


When height: 100% works
Why overflow happens
How to contain floated elements
Clearing techniques


Stacking:
Natural document flow
How z-index works
Stacking contexts
When elements overlap
