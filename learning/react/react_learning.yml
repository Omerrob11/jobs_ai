project structure:
components/common: This is where you'll put reusable UI components that you'll use across multiple pages. For example, your login form's input fields and buttons could be reused in the signup form.
components/layout: Components that form the structure of your pages, like headers and footers. These are different from common components because they're more specific to your application's layout.
pages: Each major route in your application gets its own folder here. The auth folder contains Login and SignUp since they're related but separate pages.
context: Since you're implementing authentication, you'll likely need an AuthContext to manage the user's authentication state across the application.
services: This is where your API calls will live. It helps keep your data fetching logic separate from your components.

each page its one folder:
  - make it easier to add design for this specific page, etc
