The endpoint will be /app/jobs/:id. When a user wants to update
 job with ID 123, 
they'll send a PATCH request to /app/jobs/123

Convention:
The URL should identify the !!!! resource !!!!(the job), not the action (updating)
The HTTP method (PATCH) already tells us we're updating

GET    /app/jobs      -> Get all jobs
GET    /app/jobs/123  -> Get job with ID 123
POST   /app/jobs      -> Create a new job
PATCH  /app/jobs/123  -> Update job with ID 123
DELETE /app/jobs/123  -> Delete job with ID 123

Knowledge:
- you can create any route you want:
  - app.get("/anyhtingiwant/:id")
  - its better to follow the standarts



req object:
- req.body- where we have parsed json/form data from the request.
