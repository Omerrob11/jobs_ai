First Load:
When someone types your domain (example.com) in their browser:
The browser makes an initial GET request to your server
Your server sends back the React application (HTML, JS, CSS)
React then "takes over" the browser

After Initial Load:
Once React is loaded:


Clicking links or typing URLs doesn't make new page requests
React Router handles navigation internally
The page updates without reloading
Only API calls go to the server

Initial Page Load
When you first visit your website (let's say example.com), here's what happens:

Your server sends the entire React application - all the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
This is like getting a complete user interface toolkit delivered to your browser
This typically only happens once when you first visit the site

After React is Loaded
Now that React is running in your browser:

When you navigate to /app/dashboard, React Router (in your browser) handles this navigation
The page doesn't reload - React just switches which component to show
Your React component then makes API calls to get the data it needs


You're absolutely right - after the initial load of the React application:

We don't reload the page when navigating
We just make API calls to get data
React updates the display with the new data

And yes, you're also right about the authentication pages - they're part of your React application too! The distinction isn't really between "API routes" and "other routes" - it's between:

The initial request that gets your React application
All subsequent API requests that your React components make to get data
