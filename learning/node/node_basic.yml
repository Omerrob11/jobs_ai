Route paramaters:
app.get('/jobs/:id')// 
URL would be /jobs/123

Semantics and REST conventions: Route parameters are used when the p
parameter is part of the resource's identity. A job with ID 123 is a distinct resource, 
so it makes sense to have it as part of the URL path
 Think of it like a file system - 
 each job is like a unique file with its own path.

 Query parameters, on the other hand, are better suited for:

Optional parameters
Filtering and searching (like /jobs?status=applied)
Pagination (like /jobs?page=2&limit=10)
Sorting (like /jobs?sort=date)
