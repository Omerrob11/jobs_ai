VALUES ($1, $2, $3): These are placeholders for the values we're inserting. $1 will be replaced with email, $2 with username, etc. This prevents SQL injection.
RETURNING *: Tells PostgreSQL to return the complete newly created row, including auto-generated fields like id.


About $1:
This is PostgreSQL's way of using parameterized queries. 
Instead of directly putting values in the query (which could lead to SQL injection), we use placeholders:
$1 means "first parameter"
$2 would mean "second parameter"
