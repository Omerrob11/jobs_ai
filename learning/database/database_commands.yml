When you type psql alone:

It tries to connect using your system username (in your case omermiloh)
To the database with the same name as your username

-U, --username=USERNAME # Database user name (you already know this one)
-d, --dbname=DBNAME # Database name to connect to
-h, --host=HOSTNAME # Database server host or socket directory
-p, --port=PORT # Database server port (default: 5432)
-W, --password # Force password prompt
-w, --no-password # Never prompt for password
-c, --command=COMMAND # Run a single command and exit
-f, --file=FILENAME # Execute commands from file
-l, --list # List available databases

psql # Connects as omermiloh to omermiloh database
psql -U postgres # Connects as postgres user
psql -d mydb # Connects to mydb database
psql -h localhost # Connects to local server explicitly
psql -p 5433 # Connects to port 5433 instead of default 5432
psql -l # Lists all databases

ok tell me something.

psql connets to the database server as the system username

psql -U postgres connetcts to the database server as postgres user.

but it only make sense if we have postegres user(role).

even if we have a postgres table, but not user, it will not work right?

and psql, will connect with the "superuser" ?

psql # Works (connects as omermiloh)
psql -U omermiloh # Works (same as above)
