Authentication:
json web tokens - create an encrypted token containing user data.
client store the token, server doesnt store session data

Database: postgresql, relational database:
- tables store data in rows and columns
- foreign keys esablish relationships between tables
- rich data types (json, arrays, etc)
Relational database: tables are related to each other through references
Help us to get related data - get all posts by this user id.
Help us enforce rules - a ceratin post should have a user id attach to it

- We authenticate to postgresql by roles

- posegrsql is a database server, that runs on your computer
- we need to start the server, meaning runs it in the backeground - we turn on a local database server on your machine
- we can acess it at first from our computer, and it is stored in the hardrive
- databases are protected by the user authentiocation, not exposed to the internt
- connection to postegrsql, we just connect to this local server

databases:
- we should create new databases for our project.
- postgres =# : "postegrs" is the name of the database, "=" connecte as a superuser, "#" ready to recieve commands
- omermiloh=#: you are connnecetd to a database named omermiloh, and can get command prompts. logged in as adming, can create sql commands
- omermiloh=-: incomplete command.
commands:
- psql postgres: connects to a postegrsql database server as the current mac user - postegrs refers is the default database
mening, we are authenticate to the default user by mac
you also connecting to the database named "postegrs"

- psql
  - get you into the postegrsql prompt, you can exit it with \q
  - its the postgredql interactive terminal
  - without nothing, it connect to a database matching your username, and using the operating username as the postegrsql role (user)

posegrsql:
- if you try to connect without a specifiying database, posegrsql will connect you to a database that match your mac username
- psql authenticate you as the role "omermiloh", the role of your username, and then connect you to a database name this
- like go to the office building to your cubical - you go with psql, the guard authenticate you, and direct you to ur cubical
psql  # Without a matching database
# Error: database "john" does not exist


authentication:
- we will need to set up a password for our new role to protecet the data
- we make the password for the roles - we will use it from connecting from application or remote computers
General:
- brew is a package manager for mac os, like npm. app store for developers
- enviormental variables: secret notes that only your computer can read.

Server:
- take requests from computers, process, and return a response
- database server: it take queries, and serves data. the "api" is the database



Enviorment:
- we can save the acess into the enviorment to acess later.
- we can save the password to the enviorment, in our case: DATABASE_PASSWORD


Migrations:
- basically, version control for your database
- help you identify how the database is changing


Models:
- database is different from buisness modles



superuser:
- superuser is the role with full administrative priviliges:
  - can do anything to database, other roles, etc.



Database storage:
When you run PostgreSQL locally, the data is stored on your computer's hard drive
The actual data is stored in binary files that PostgreSQL manages
In Production:

Could be on a dedicated database server
Could be on a cloud service (like AWS RDS, Heroku Postgres)


Database hirearchy:
Blog Platform Example:

One-to-Many Relationship: One user can have many jobs
Foreign Keys: Jobs table will have a user_id that references the Users table
Cascading: If you delete a user, you might want to delete all their jobs too

Users
└── Blog Posts (each user can have many posts)
    └── Comments (each post can have many comments)
        └── Replies (each comment can have many replies)
    └── Categories (each post can belong to multiple categories)
    └── Tags (each post can have multiple tags)

This is achieved through foreign keys:
- Each blog post has a user_id (pointing to its author)
- Each comment has a post_id (pointing to its post)
- Each reply has a comment_id (pointing to its parent comment)


Pools:
- we need to talk with the database
- we need a connections to the database - pools, have a bunch of connetsions
- we borrow a connection from the pool, now we can talk with the database, and run the query
- than we return the connection to the pool

pool has 5 connections ready
for each request:
   borrow connection from pool
   run query
   return connection to pool
