WEB development concepts for the ai developer.

Hi, im milo, and this blog is going to talk about fundamentals web development concepts for the ai developer

I think that the future will belong to ai developers - people inside companies, that have now background in development.
but are using ai agents to build company internal tools.

This blog is cater for them:
alltough I belive ai could take care all of the development in the near future
understanding the concepts - not how to implement it, would be valuable to help you understand why the agent chose this path and not the other.
and will help you communicate with your fellow workers.

The blog is assuming that you:

- know programming syntax. ai developer do know how to program, but not that good compared to the developer in the pre-ai era.
- belive the future is not in the implementation, but the understanding and building systems.
- want to understand why things works as they are, understand the fundamentals simple concepts in a non-programming language.

I belive that we the concepts are simple and you don't even need to be engineer to understand those.

The blog will cater to web and native development only, and will talk about:

- web development
- ai tools
- using ai properly as augmenting vs replacing toughts.

this is not a deep dive into tech.
im in the beginning of my journey, a journey of years to come.
the blog is not caterd to the pre-ai developer
so if you are in for extremely in depth tutorials, this is not _yet_ the blog.

Authentication - how it works, etc.
